# testHelpfulOwl

If you would like to test my application do the following:

1) create a repository on Github (or use an existing Github repo).

2) For various reasons I'd like to know if the credentials that my program finds are real or not. If you used the test credentials I give you, my program will be able to understand that they are just test credentials. Please add a file to that repository which has the following lines of code:

secret = "1OkassfgC5dGwtflUn5c+TaIDVSrLKJHGzwrQptA"

key = "AKIAILRI2UN6EOOGN41Q"

3) You should recieve an email from helpfulowl500@gmail.com within seconds.

4) If you do not recieve an email, could you let me know? This is still a work in progress, and any feedback would be great.

5) The application only send's an email to an email address only once a day to avoid spamming people that made several commits with credentials in them. I understand that this is not an optimal solution, and it is on my list of things to change.
